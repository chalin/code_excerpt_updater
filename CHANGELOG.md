# Changelog

## 0.8.1

- Support `code-excerpt` instructions as the first line
  in a markdown list that starts with `-` or `*`.

## 0.8.0

- Deprecate processing instruction syntax without `?` before the closing `>`.
- Support strip-whitespace syntax `{%-...-%}` for prettify tags.

## 0.7.2

- Accept `{% prettify %}` with more than one argument.

## 0.7.1

- Strictly match code block marker start/end kinds.
  E.g., now only `{% endprettify %}` is accepted as 
  the end of a prettify code block (not a triple backtick).
  In this way prettify blocks can contain triple backtick markers.

## 0.7.0

- Support `code-excerpt` `remove` attribute.

## 0.6.1

- Add `class` as a recognized `code-excerpt` attribute.

## 0.6.0

- Support `code-excerpt` `retain` attribute.
- Report an error for unrecognized `code-excerpt` attributes.

## 0.5.3

- Don't warn about instructions having a `class`
  argument but no `title` since these are processed
  by other tools.

## 0.5.2

- Support the `--replace="/.../.../g; ..."` command line option.

## 0.5.1

- Support the following special characters in replace arguments:
  `\t`, `\n`, and hexadecimal character codes `\xHH`.

## 0.5.0

- Support global replace instruction.

## 0.4.1

- Fix: a `replace` regexp with `}`  would break the parsing of `code-excerpt` args.

## 0.4.0

- Support multiple semi-colon separated "/foo/bar/g" expressions as arguments to `replace`.

## 0.3.1

- Support escaped backslash characters (`\/`) in the replace expression of 
  replace attributes; e.g., `replace="/(foo)/$&\/bar/g"` will replace
  `foo` by `foo/bar`.

## 0.3.0

- Add support for code blocks braced between `{% prettify opt-lang %}` and
  `{% endprettify %}`, as used in site-www.
- Add support for `$&` is replacement expressions of the `replace` attribute.

## 0.2.0

- Add support for `code-excerpt` `replace` attributes having arguments of the form
  **/_regex_/_replacement_/g**. Like in JavaScript, _replacement_ can contain
  match capture placeholders `$1`, `$2`, etc. `$$` escapes `$`.

## 0.1.0

- When a code excerpt consists of an entire file, and no corresponding fragment
  file is found, an attempt is made to find the file in source directory.
- Any `#docregion` tags that appear in file diffs are filtered.

## 0.0.1

- First public version, based on
  [github.com/chalin/api_doc_updater](https://github.com/chalin/api_doc_updater).
